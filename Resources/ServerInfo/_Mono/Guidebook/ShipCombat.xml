  # Ship Warfare

Warfare on the frontier is usually done via the means of [color=orange]ship gunnery[/color].

There are 3 types of ship weaponry available:
 - [color=gold]Ballistics[/color], which are weapons like autocannons, railguns, and all other unguided chemical-propellant weapons.
 - [color=MediumVioletRed]Energy[/color], which are weapons like plasma weaponry, lasers, and other similar non-chemical based weapons.
 - [color=GreenYellow]Missiles[/color], which are all guided munitions. It explains itself.

Ship weapons all need a [color=orange]gunnery control console[/color] and a [color=slateblue]gunnery control server[/color] to function. They will be abbreviated to [color=orange]GCC[/color] and [color=slateblue]GCS[/color] in most instances.

Ship weapons only fire if they are selected and if your cursor on the [color=orange]GCC[/color] is in the FOV of the turret.

Missiles performance varies per missile quite a bit!
For example,  ASM-302 for example has
  - an acceleration of [color=khaki][bold]20 m/s[/bold][/color]
  - a detection and tracking range of [color=khaki][bold]800 meters[/bold][/color]
  - a scanning arc of [color=khaki][bold]65 degrees[/bold][/color]
  - a launch speed of [color=khaki][bold]60 m/s[/bold][/color]
  - a max speed of [color=khaki][bold]140 m/s[/bold][/color].

## Shield Generators

Some ships are equipped with [color=cyan]shield generators[/color]. These absorb all incoming impacts, and add power draw for every projectile absorbed.

Due to the rarity of these, they are unable to be looted, and must be scavenged if you wish to outfit your ship with them.
The most popular shield system for example, the [bold][color=cyan]MS-225[/color][/bold], adds [bold][color=coral]500w[/color][/bold] to the power usage for every impact absorbed.
After [bold]10 seconds[/bold], this power surge will start to dissipate. However there is a base power draw, and it is calculated via the following equation.

Radius^2 * Shield Width * 0.5 * Power/m^2.

  ## Bluespace Drives

  Many large, expedition, and combat ships are equipped with a [color=dodgerblue]Bluespace Drive[/color].

These increase the ship's FTL range by a certain amount if powered. For the [color=dodgerblue][bold]CTLA-25[/bold][/color], this range is [bold]2500m[/bold]
